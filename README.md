# Fix My Code Challenge

Fix my code is a new type of project, where we'll jump into an existing code 
base and fix it! This is done using pre-written repos as initial files for all 
solutions. I'm not coding anything new, just fixing the existing code base.

Project provided by ALX related with debugging various programs.
The challenges includes different programming languages 
from C to Python to Javascript to Ruby and more, some of which I was familiar 
with, others of which I was not. The specific list of projects contained follows:
